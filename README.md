## Scheduler

Halti scheduler is implemented in clojure and can be found from here https://github.com/emblica/halti-server/blob/master/src/clojure/halti_server/scheduler.clj

Scheduler tries to work with these limits and optimize the container configuration:

**Implemented:**   
- Try to find best usage of resources
- Keep same instances of service in different machines
- If there is capability that is needed for service try to put it to machine that provides those capabilities
**Not implemented yet:**  
- For already running containers don't move  them if you don't have to
- Try to distribute services in different locations if possible
- Try to put dependent services close to each other (same neighborhood if possible)


### Missing features

- Scheduler implements locations and neighbourhood but the feature isn't yet enabled.
- Security and authentication with all connections between cluster

### Bugs

not known bugs currently
