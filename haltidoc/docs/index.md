## Scheduler

Halti scheduler is implemented in clojure and can be found from here https://github.com/emblica/halti-server/blob/master/src/clojure/halti_server/scheduler.clj

Scheduler tries to work with these limits and optimize the container configuration:

**Implemented:**   
- Try to find best usage of resources
- Keep same instances of service in different machines
- If there is capability that is needed for service try to put it to machine that provides those capabilities


### Missing features
